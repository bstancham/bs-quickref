V = voltage             --- in volts
I = intensity (current) --- in amperes
R = resistance          --- in ohms
P = power               --- in watts

LED

Voltage sensitivity: LEDs must be supplied with a voltage above their THRESHOLD VOLTAGE and a current below their rating.
Current and lifetime change greatly with a small change in applied voltage. They thus require a current-regulated supply (usually just a series resistor for indicator LEDs).[
